# VRC Avatar Unity Bones Copier

This repository contains the source code for a simple utility to copy DynamicBones from one prefab to another. The bones in the armature wont line up exactly so it provides the user with dropdowns for where the bones should be copied to.

## Goals

This is a project under development, eventually you will be able to
- Save bone configurations for easy copying
- Copy Dynamic Bone and Dynamic Bone Collider
- Import this project as a unity package
